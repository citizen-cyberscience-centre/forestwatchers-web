Simple Flask web application to create web page prototypes using Twitter
Bootstrap as the CSS framework.

This application saves you time creating a prototype, as you will not have to
write every header, footer, etc. Everything is configured using global
variables and different partials: _navbar.html, _footer.html, etc.

Take a look at the templates (it uses Jinja2), and copy and paste the
index.html to create new pages. Then, all you have to do is add more routes in
web.py.
